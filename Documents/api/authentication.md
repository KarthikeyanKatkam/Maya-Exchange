# Maya Exchange API Authentication

## Overview
Maya Exchange uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for securing API endpoints. Each user must authenticate with the platform to receive a token that grants access to protected resources.

## **How Authentication Works**

1. **User Login**:
   - The user submits their email and password to the `/api/v1/users/login` endpoint.
   - Upon successful authentication, the server responds with a JWT token and its expiration time.

2. **Token Usage**:
   - The client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.
   - Example:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
     ```

3. **Token Validation**:
   - The backend verifies the tokenâ€™s signature and expiration before granting access to the requested resource.

2. **Response**:
